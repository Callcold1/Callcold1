# Hi there! 👋

I'm **Kev**, a passionate programmer currently studying at **42 Berlin** and nearing the completion of the **Common Core**. I thrive on solving complex problems and writing efficient, well-structured code, whether it's at the system level or high-level application development.

## 💡 About Me
- I have a strong interest in **low-level programming**, focusing on performance, memory management, and efficient data structures.
- I enjoy working with **system programming**, diving into Unix system calls, process management, and networking.
- I believe in writing **clean, maintainable code** that is both scalable and well-documented.
- I love challenging myself with **algorithms, optimisation problems, security concepts, computer graphics, and DevOps practices**.

## 🚀 What I’ve been working on
- **Web Server in C++**: Implementing a non-blocking HTTP server from scratch, handling requests, responses, and chunked transfer encoding.
- **Containerisation & DevOps**: Deploying services using **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and setting up **NGINX, MariaDB, and WordPress**.
- **Unix & Networking**: Exploring system-level programming, socket communication, and event-driven architectures.
- **MiniRT**: Implementing a **simple ray tracer**, focusing on **graphics, mathematical modeling, and rendering techniques**.
- **Minishell**: Developing a **Unix shell** with **command parsing, execution, signals, pipes, and redirections**.
- **Algorithmic Challenges**: Improving my problem-solving skills with data structures and algorithm challenges.
